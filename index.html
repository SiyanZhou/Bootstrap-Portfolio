                                <p>User experience design is the process of enhancing user satisfaction with a product by improving
                                    the usability, accessibility, and pleasure provided in the interaction with the product.User
                                    experience design encompasses traditional humanâ€“computer interaction (HCI) design, and
                                    extends it by addressing all aspects of a product or service as perceived by users.
                                </p>

                                <p>Poorly designed human-machine interfaces can lead to many unexpected problems. A classic
                                    example of this is the Three Mile Island accident, a nuclear meltdown accident, where
                                    investigations concluded that the design of the human-machine interface was at least
                                    partly responsible for the disaster.[8][9][10] Similarly, accidents in aviation have
                                    resulted from manufacturers' decisions to use non-standard flight instrument or throttle
                                    quadrant layouts: even though the new designs were proposed to be superior in basic human-machine
                                    interaction, pilots had already ingrained the "standard" layout and thus the conceptually
                                    good idea actually had undesirable results.</p>

                                <p>Humans interact with computers in many ways; the interface between humans and computers is
                                    crucial to facilitating this interaction. Desktop applications, internet browsers, handheld
                                    computers, and computer kiosks make use of the prevalent graphical user interfaces (GUI)
                                    of today.[5] Voice user interfaces (VUI) are used for speech recognition and synthesising
                                    systems, and the emerging multi-modal and Graphical user interfaces (GUI) allow humans
                                    to engage with embodied character agents in a way that cannot be achieved with other
                                    interface paradigms. The growth in human-computer interaction field has been in quality
                                    of interaction, and in different branching in its history. Instead of designing regular
                                    interfaces, the different research branches have had a different focus on the concepts
                                    of multimodality rather than unimodality, intelligent adaptive interfaces rather than
                                    command/action based ones, and finally active rather than passive interfaces.[citation
                                    needed] For instance, more recently, sensors like video cameras and eye trackers can
                                    be used to feed physiological information of humans back to computer systems.[6][7] Such
                                    information can be used by computers to dynamically adapt content of interfaces. Thus,
                                    computers could develop responsiveness to cognitive load[7] and human emotion[6].</p>
